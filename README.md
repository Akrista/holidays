**THIS PACKAGE IS IN DEVELOPMENT, DON'T USE IT IN PRODUCTION (YET)**

Calculate which days you don't have to work!

At the moment only Belgium public holidays are supported. You can always send a PR with your country. Don't forget to include tests.

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holiday;

$holidays = Holiday::all();
```

Or for a specific country and year.

```php
use Spatie\Holidays\Holiday;

$holidays = Holiday::new()
    ->forYear(2024)
    ->forCountry('BE')
    ->get();
```
